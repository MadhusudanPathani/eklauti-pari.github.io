		<p style="font-size:24px">Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful princess named Kulsum. She had always been fascinated by fairies and wished to become one herself. However, her parents, the king, and queen, insisted that she should focus on becoming a proper princess and marrying a prince. So she used to be sad.<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52832344944_9c898711a8_c.jpg" width="300" align="center" alt="IMG_20230420_202038"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Kulsum's sister, Mehraj, was more interested in sword fighting and adventure. She often talked about becoming a knight and going on quests. One day, Madhusudan, a brave knight from a neighboring kingdom, visited the royal family. He and Mehraj immediately hit it off and started planning an adventure together.</p>

		<p style="font-size:24px">Kulsum was sad that she couldn't join them, but she still dreamed of becoming a fairy. One night, she had a vivid dream where a fairy appeared to her and told her about a magical land where fairies lived. Kulsum woke up feeling excited and determined to find this place.<br><br><br>

The next morning, she packed a bag with some food and set off on her own adventure. She walked for hours until she stumbled upon a cave. As she entered, she saw a dragon sleeping in the middle of the room. Kulsum knew she had to be brave if she wanted to become a fairy, so she summoned all her courage and tiptoed past the dragon.</p>

		<p style="font-size:24px">She emerged on the other side of the cave and saw a beautiful forest in the distance. Kulsum walked towards it and saw a group of fairies fluttering about. She ran towards them and told them about her dream and her desire to become a fairy. The fairies were touched by her passion and decided to help her.<br><br><br>

They gave her a magical potion and told her to drink it at midnight under a full moon. Kulsum thanked them and ran back towards the castle to meet her sister and Madhusudan.</p>

		<p style="font-size:24px">When she arrived, she saw that the castle was under attack by the very same dragon she had just encountered. Mehraj and Madhusudan were fighting it with all their might, but they were struggling. Kulsum knew that she had to help, so she ran towards the dragon and threw the magical potion at it. The dragon was instantly transformed into a cat named Navyatha.<br><br><br>

Everyone was amazed, and they realized that the dragon was not evil, but under a spell. They were grateful to Kulsum and praised her bravery. That night, under a full moon, Kulsum drank the remaining potion and became a fairy.</p>

		<p style="font-size:24px">From that day on, Kulsum, Mehraj, and Madhusudan went on many adventures together, but none as magical as the one where Kulsum became a fairy. They lived happily ever after, with Navyatha the cat by their side.</p>
